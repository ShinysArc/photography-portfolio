          I'm St√©phane, and welcome to my photogtaphy portfolio. I've always had a camera close by,
          what started as a small hobby quickly became something I can't imagine leaving behind.

          , I spent countless nights shooting parties, and events. Those experiences taught me how
          to capture people's energy, movement, and the atmosphere of a moment before it fades.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of events, I take my camera everywhere I go. When I travel, it's always one of the
          first things I pack. I love taking portraits of friends, wandering through new streets,
          and finding beauty in small, quiet details that most people might overlook.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also enjoy simple walks with no destination, just me and my camera, seeing what catches
          my eye.
